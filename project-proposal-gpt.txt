💻 Intermediate C++ Project
Task Manager styled as a “mini-Notion in the console”

Yes. Something real, useful, and designed to require serious programming thinking.

🎯 Objective

Create a console application that allows task management with file persistence, data structures, input validation, and clean logic.

🧠 Technical Requirements (Mandatory)

This project must use:

struct or class

vector

enum

File handling (fstream)

Well-separated functions

User input validation

Interactive menu

Clear logic (nothing entirely inside main)

🗂️ Data Model

Each task must include:

id (int)

title (string)

description (string)

priority (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)

status (enum: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)

📋 Minimum Features

📌 Create a task

📄 List all tasks

🔍 View a task by ID

✏️ Edit a task

❌ Delete a task

💾 Save tasks to a file (tasks.txt)

📂 Load tasks when the program starts

If the data is not saved, the behavior is considered incorrect.

📁 Persistence

Use either a text file or a binary file.

At program startup:

If the file exists → load tasks

If it does not exist → start with an empty state

⭐ Optional Extensions

Choose at least one:

🔎 Filter tasks by priority or status

🔄 Sort tasks (by priority or ID)

🔐 Confirmation before deletion

📊 Counter for completed tasks

🧪 Basic error handling

🧩 Real Difficulty

This project:

Is NOT beginner-level

Requires design-oriented thinking

Prepares for larger-scale projects

Serves as a direct foundation for GUI applications or database-backed systems

This is the appropriate level for intermediate development.
