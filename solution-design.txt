1. Software architecture:
    - Program runs in console (CLI).
    - Uses a menu-driven loop.
    - Data stored in memory using a vector.
    - Data persisted using SQLite database.
    - SQLite accessed through a dedicated database layer.
    - Single executable program.
2. Modules / Components
    - Task model: ID, title, description, priority, status, etc. 
    - Task manager: Task creation, editing, deletion and in-memory storage. 
    - Database manager (SQLite): Handles all SQLite  operations. 
    - Menu / UI
    - Validation
3. Main flow
    1. Program starts.
    2. Open SQLite database connection
    3. Create tasks table if it does not exist
    4. Load tasks from database into vector. 
    5. Show interactive menu. 
    6. User selects an option. 
    7. Execute selected action.
    8. Update vector after DB operations. 
    9. Repeat until exit. 
    10. Close database connection. 
    11. End program. 
4. Error handling
    - Incorrect or non-existent ID -> show message and repeat 5 
    - Task manager: Incorrect action selected -> show message and repeat 5
    - Task manager/task creation or editing/priority: Incorrect or non-existent 
    priority selected -> show message and repeat selection.
    - Task manager/deletion incorrect or non-existent ID -> show message and ask for the right ID
5. Technical Decisions
    - Use SQLite instead of text or bin file: provides structured 
    storage and persistence.
    - Keep tasks in memory using vector: Faster access and simpler logic.
    - Separate database logic into databaseManager: Improves maintainability
    and separation of concerns.
    - Use CLI instead of GUI (GUI can be added after the logic is polished):
    Focus on core logic and requirements.
